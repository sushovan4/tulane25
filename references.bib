    abstract = {The Rips complex at scale r of a set of points X in a metric space is the abstract simplicial complex whose faces are determined by finite subsets of X of diameter less than r. We prove that for X in the Euclidean 3-space R3 the natural projection map from the Rips complex of X to its shadow in R3 induces a surjection on fundamental groups. This partially answers a question of Chambers, de Silva, Erickson and Ghrist who studied this projection for subsets of R2. We further show that Rips complexes of finite subsets of Rn are universal, in that they model all homotopy types of simplicial complexes PL-embeddable in Rn. As an application we get that any finitely presented group appears as the fundamental group of a Rips complex of a finite subset of R4. We furthermore show that if the Rips complex of a finite point set in R2 is a normal pseudomanifold of dimension at least two then it must be the boundary of a crosspolytope.},

	abstract = {The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is a flexible measure of dissimilarity between graphs which arises in error-correcting graph matching. It is defined from an optimal sequence of edit operations (edit path) transforming one graph into another. Unfortunately, the exact computation of this measure is NP-hard. In the last decade, several approaches were proposed to approximate the GED in polynomial time, mainly by solving linear programming problems. Among them, the bipartite GED received much attention. It is deduced from a linear sum assignment of the nodes of the two graphs, which can be efficiently computed by Hungarian-type algorithms. However, edit operations on nodes and edges are not handled simultaneously, which limits the accuracy of the approximation. To overcome this limitation, we propose to extend the linear assignment model to a quadratic one. This is achieved through the definition of a family of edit paths induced by assignments between nodes. We formally show that the GED, restricted to the paths in this family, is equivalent to a quadratic assignment problem. Since this problem is NP-hard, we propose to compute an approximate solution by adapting two algorithms: Integer Projected Fixed Point method and Graduated Non Convexity and Concavity Procedure. Experiments show that the proposed approach is generally able to reach a more accurate approximation of the exact GED than the bipartite GED, with a computational cost that is still affordable for graphs of non trivial sizes.},

As a matter of fact, object representation by means of graphs has a number of advantages over feature vectors. Therefore, various algorithms for graph based machine learning have been proposed in the literature. However, in contrast with the emerging interest in graph based representation, a lack of standardized graph data sets for benchmarking can be observed. Common practice is that researchers use their own data sets, and this behavior cumbers the objective evaluation of the proposed methods. In order to make the diﬀerent approaches in graph based machine learning better comparable, the present paper aims at introducing a repository of graph data sets and corresponding benchmarks, covering a wide spectrum of diﬀerent applications.},

	abstract = {Graph edit distance (GED) is a powerful and flexible graph matching paradigm that can be used to address different tasks in structural pattern recognition, machine learning, and data mining. In this paper, some new binary linear programming formulations for computing the exact GED between two graphs are proposed. A major strength of the formulations lies in their genericity since the GED can be computed between directed or undirected fully attributed graphs (i.e. with attributes on both vertices and edges). Moreover, a relaxation of the domain constraints in the formulations provides efficient lower bound approximations of the GED. A complete experimental study comparing the proposed formulations with 4 state-of-the-art algorithms for exact and approximate graph edit distances is provided. By considering both the quality of the proposed solution and the efficiency of the algorithms as performance criteria, the results show that none of the compared methods dominates the others in the Pareto sense. As a consequence, faced to a given real-world problem, a trade-off between quality and efficiency has to be chosen w.r.t. the application constraints. In this context, this paper provides a guide that can be used to choose the appropriate method.},

However, existing methods for the GED computation suffer from several drawbacks including oversized search space, huge memory consumption, and lots of expensive backtracking. In this paper, we present BSS GED, a novel vertex-based mapping method for the GED computation. First, we create a small search space by reducing the number of invalid and redundant mappings involved in the GED computation. Then, we utilize beam-stack search combined with two heuristics to efﬁciently compute GED, achieving a ﬂexible trade-off between available memory and expensive backtracking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BSS GED is highly efﬁcient for the GED computation on sparse as well as dense graphs and outperforms the state-of-the-art GED methods. In addition, we also apply BSS GED to the graph similarity search problem and the practical results conﬁrm its efﬁciency.},

In this work, we define a combinatorial distance for Reeb graphs of orientable surfaces in terms of the cost necessary to transform one graph into another by edit operations.

More precisely, the stability result states that changes in the Reeb graphs, measured by the edit distance, are as small as changes in the functions, measured by the maximum norm. The optimality result states that the edit distance discriminates Reeb graphs better than any other distance for Reeb graphs of surfaces satisfying the stability property.},

This chapter focuses on syntactic pattern recognition. Syntactic pattern recognition adapts the techniques of formal language theory, which provide both a notation and an analysis mechanism to the problem of representing and analyzing patterns containing a significant syntactic content. Regardless of the precise form of the data, syntactic analysis can proceed only if a grammatical model for the data generation and/or analysis process can be formulated. The structural description of the language in terms of a grammar is called syntax of the language. Analysis in terms of this structure is called—syntactic analysis or parsing. A related practical problem is the development of efficient analysis procedures based on the grammatical model. In formal language theory, the only relation between the elements in a string, either a terminal string or an intermediate string containing nonterminals, is concatenation, that is, the juxtaposition of adjacent elements. The first step in formulating a syntactic model for pattern analysis is the determination of a set of primitives, in terms of which the data of interest can be described. This can be largely influenced by the nature of the data, the specific application in question, and the technology available for implementing the analysis.}

In order to apply this distance measure, the graphs are characterised by descriptive graph grammars (DGG). The proposed distance measure is based on the computation of the minimum number of modifications required to transform an input graph into the reference one. Specifically, the distance measure is defined as the cost of recognition of nodes plus the number of transformations which include node insertion, node deletion, branch insertion, branch deletion, node label substitution and branch label substitution. The major difference between the proposed distance measure and the other ones is the consideration of the cost of recognition of nodes in the distance computation. In order to do this, the principal features of the nodes are described by one or several cost functions which are used to compute the similarity between the input nodes and the reference ones. Finally, an application of this distance measure to the recognition of lower case handwritten English characters is presented.},

	abstract = {Graph edit distance has been used since 1983 to compare objects in machine learning when these objects are represented by attributed graphs instead of vectors. In these cases, the graph edit distance is usually applied to deduce a distance between attributed graphs. This distance is defined as the minimum amount of edit operations (deletion, insertion and substitution of nodes and edges) needed to transform a graph into another. Since now, it has been stated that the distance properties have to be applied [(1) non-negativity (2) symmetry (3) identity and (4) triangle inequality] to the involved edit operations in the process of computing the graph edit distance to make the graph edit distance a metric. In this paper, we show that there is no need to impose the triangle inequality in each edit operation. This is an important finding since in pattern recognition applications, the classification ratio usually maximizes in the edit operation combinations (deletion, insertion and substitution of nodes and edges) that the triangle inequality is not fulfilled.},

Graph edit distance is one of the most widely accepted measures to determine similarities between graphs and has extensive applications in the fields of pattern recognition, computer vision etc. Unfortunately, the problem of graph edit distance computation is NP-Hard in general. Accordingly, in this paper we introduce three novel methods to compute the upper and lower bounds for the edit distance between two graphs in polynomial time. Applying these methods, two algorithms AppFull and AppSub are introduced to perform different kinds of graph search on graph databases. Comprehensive experimental studies are conducted on both real and synthetic datasets to examine various aspects of the methods for bounding graph edit distance. Result shows that these methods achieve good scalability in terms of both the number of graphs and the size of graphs. The effectiveness of these algorithms also confirms the usefulness of using our bounds in filtering and searching of graphs.},

A general formulation for editing graphs is used to derive a graph edit distance that is proven to be a metric, provided the cost function for individual edit operations is a metric. Then, a binary linear program is developed for computing this graph edit distance, and polynomial time methods for determining upper and lower bounds on the solution of the binary program are derived by applying solution methods for standard linear programming and the assignment problem. A recognition problem of comparing a sample input graph to a database of known prototype graphs in the context of a chemical information system is presented as an application of the new method. The costs associated with various edit operations are chosen by using a minimum normalized variance criterion applied to pairwise distances between nearest neighbors in the database of prototypes. The new metric is shown to perform quite well in comparison to existing metrics when applied to a database of chemical graphs.},
